# Shiny package is a great tool for creating interactive graphs. I won't go into too much detail,
# i'll just mention different kinds of inputs for playing with the data. Those inputs are: input_select(),
# input_radiobuttons(), input_checkbox(), input_checkboxgroup(), input_numeric(), input_slider(), input_text().
# Here are some simple examples of interactive graphs created with ggvis and shiny.

faithful %>% 
  ggvis(~waiting, ~eruptions, fillOpacity := 0.5, 
        shape := input_select(label = "Choose shape:", 
                              choices = c("circle", "square", "cross", "diamond", 
                                          "triangle-up", "triangle-down")),
        fill := input_select(label = "Choose color:", 
                             choices = c("black", "red", "blue", "green"))) %>% 
  layer_points()

# Additionally, radio buttons which control the fill of the graph
mtcars %>% 
  ggvis(~mpg, ~wt,
        fill := input_radiobuttons(label = "Choose color:",
                                    choices = c("black", "red", "blue", "green"))) %>% 
  layer_points()
