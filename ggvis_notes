# Just a simple example of a plot manipulation, based on pressure dataset
pressure %>% ggvis(~temperature, ~pressure, stroke := "red", strokeWidth := 2, strokeDash := 6) %>% layer_lines()

# The difference between = and := operators:
# = MAPS property onto variable,
# := SETS property to be equal to a given value

# PIPING is very useful here since there are many arguments and properties to the ggvis and it's easy to generate unreadable code

# ggvis helps in creating maps - i'm able to connect data points in a specific order so that they create polygons
