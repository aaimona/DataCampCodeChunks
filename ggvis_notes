# The difference between = and := operators:
# = MAPS property onto variable,
# := SETS property to be equal to a given value

# PIPING is very useful here since there are many arguments and properties to the ggvis and it's easy to generate unreadable code

# ggvis helps in creating maps - i'm able to connect data points in a specific order so that they create polygons

# In this one i'm trying to walk through what layer_smooths() does, i.e. first i'm using compute_smooths()
# to create a set of coordinates that could be depicted as points, and second, i'm plotting those coordinates
# with column ~pred_ as x and column ~resp_ as y. 
# compute_smooths() always returns data.frame with columns pred_ and resp_, that is why the order of columns
# in compute_smooths() 2nd argument is y(resp_) ~ x(pred_) - i'm preducting y with x.
