# THE BASICS OF R MARKDOWN: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf

# R markdown syntax is extremely useful for someone preparing reports on a regular basis.
# It helps to embed data, graphs or even beautiful mathematical equations into such report.
# As for the .Rmd syntax itself, there are several formatting instructions that i need to remember,
# and i won't go into too many details, it's all here: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html

# What is really worth noting is that .Rmd file can make use of LaTeX syntax to create beautiful, elegant equations:
#         $$ fahrenheit = celsius \times \frac{5}{9} + 32 $$
# Double dollar sign is used to put the equation in a new line, in a separate block;
# \times mean times (*);
# \frac introduces fraction, where
# first {} is numerator and second {} is denominator

# KNITR
# When i want to insert some code, e.g. in order to show how i cleaned my data,
# i need to surround my code with the following structure:
```{r}
# code here
```
# if the code returns any result, it will insert this result in the .Rmd report.
# Since each .Rmd document is given a fresh session of R, i have to load all packages i'm using,
# define each variable i created etc., because the report won't have access to the environment of my current R session.

# OFten the code i embed into the report may return some messages, warnings or errors. 
# If i don't want them to show, i add to the code in the following manner:
```{r message = FALSE}
library(nasaweather)
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)
```
# It is also important to remember to make a package loading chunk of code the first we embed
# - so that next chunks have access to those packages.

# CODE CHUNKS OPTIONS
# I can choose how i want my code to function in the report. Here are three options:
# echo = FALSE - R will not display the code, but it will run it and display its results,
# eval = FALSE - R will not run the code or display its results, but it will display the code itself,
# results = 'hide' - R will not display the results of code, but it will run it and display the code itself

# AUTOMATING REPORTS
# I can automate reports by adding fields depending on the value of a variable defined earlier.
For the remainder of the report, we will look only at data from the year `r year`
# `r year` inside the sentence means that instead of it the final rendered report will contain the value of the year variable

# LABELING OF CODE CHUNKS
```{r chained, results='hide'}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(factor(cyl)) %>%
  ggvis(~mpg, ~wt, fill = ~cyl) %>% 
  layer_points()
```


```{r ref.label = 'chained', echo = FALSE}
```
# First i name the code chunk directly after r in ```{r} syntax, then i ref it with ref.label = 'chunk_name'

# I could give a YAML "header" to my .Rmd document, like the one below:
---
title: "Cloud Cover"
author: "Anonymous"
date: "December 2, 2014"
output: pdf_document
---
# and R will knit a nice-looking header in the document i will create.
# The last line, output, could be modified in order to change the output format:
# html_document, pdf_document, word_document, beamer_presentation etc.

# If i want to further customize my output, there's a lot ways to do it by overwriting options.
# A thorough guide on this can be found here: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf
# I can make my report use css, add table of contents, change theme etc.

# R MARKDOWN FEAT. SHINY
# I can make my .Rmd reports interactive with collaboration with Shiny package.
# I just need to add "runtime: shiny" line in my YAML header and make sure that the output format is
# one of the following: html_document, slidy_presentation or ioslides_presentation
